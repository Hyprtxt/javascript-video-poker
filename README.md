# Poker

A Simple poker game

## Developers

Get started locally (with *nix npm and git)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/digitaldesigndj/javascript-video-poker poker
cd poker
npm install
docpad run
```

Then visit [http://localhost:9887](http://localhost:9887)

**set the environment variable `PORT` to use a custom one**

## Keyboard Controls

`Enter` to deal/start game, `1-5` to hold.

## Remove Payout Table

**hidden features**

Use the score tab to hide and show the payout table. You have to refresh the app to get it back. HTML5 LocalStorage means you will not lose your stats, they are stored in the browser. They don't sync yet.

## ToDo

* Hold All Button


### Tracking

* Track Gone Brokes
* Reset Hands Played After Broke?
* Track Max Hands Played


#### Further in the future

* Docker Container
* Database for Stat Tracking
* Social Login (Google, FB)
* Editable/Selectable Payout Tables


## Disclaimer

Use this code freely, you can even close the source for your own use if you want to. Contributing back would be nice. I'm not a lawyer and I think MIT means: "Don't sue me bro". I'm not in this game for lawsuits, you don't even need to credit me. It's just code! [PLUR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLUR).
